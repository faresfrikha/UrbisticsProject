Urbistics Project


The housing crisis is one of the most serious to hit nowadays more than half of the Tunisian population that are concentrated around new cities, in neighborhoods composed of indecent spontaneous habitats created from scratch since the existing way of building costs a lot.

This high cost of the building is mainly due to the share important building materials imported or using at some level of their production of significant energy. The prices of these materials therefore depend on the international market constantly destabilized by the recent energy crisis years. To produce housing at lower cost, it is important therefore to circumvent the influence of the cost of energy by upgrading local building materials.

Our study will be divided into five chapters. The first, will present the local materials usable in the building, the difference between them, and their valorization. Chapter two will present the sizing calculations of various structures based on a standard SNHLM plan. chapter three, the economic calculation tables will be presenting the building costs, as for chapter 4 it will present the analyzes and comments on the results obtained. Finally the chapter 5 concludes and will propose subsequent studies to follow this project.
